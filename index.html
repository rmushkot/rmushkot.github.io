                                        I graduated from UCSC in June of 2020 with a B.S. Cum Laude in Computer Science with a GPA of 3.58/4.00. My education allowed me to take a large variety of 
                                        classes, each giving me unique skills. I took courses such as Operating Systems, Distributed Systems, Computer Architecture, Artifical Intelligence, Database Systems, 
                                        and many more. These courses gave me the skills needed to succeed in the industry and taught me how to learn and adapt to new technologies.

                                        In addition to courses, I was also a Student Supervisor at one of the Dining Halls on campus. My responsibilties included ensuring that all safety precautions were 
                                        being upheld as well as auditing safety paperwork. Additionally I would guide student workers to completion of tasks at numerous cooking and serving stations and was responsible for training and hiring new students. 
                                        This position taught me so much about leadership and responsibilty and these lessons will stick with me throughout my life.

                                        For six months I worked on SAP's HANA database to improve the performance of a key function as a part of a sponsorship through UCSC. HANA servers over 32,000 enterprise customers all over the world
                                        with a purpose of providing a high performance, data-driven, and real-time decision-making database. HANA is constructed into two partions, one optimized for read operations
                                        and the other optimized for write operations. Due to the structure of HANA, a crucial operation called <i>Delta Merge</i> is used to merge data from the write partition into the read partition. 
                                        Delta Merge handles millions of column entries every time it runs so speed and efficency is essential. You can find more information on the Delta Merge <a href="https://archive.sap.com/kmuuid2/10681c09-6276-2f10-78b8-986c68efb9c8/How%20To%20-%20Delta%20Merge%20for%20SAP%20HANA%20and%20SAP%20NetWeaver%20BW%20powered%20by%20SAP%20HANA.pdf"

                                        Working with both SAP and Intel, my team and I aimed to increase the data throughput of the Delta Merge operation. Originally SAP's implementation was able to achieve a 5-10 GB/s
                                        throughput. Our plan to improve upon this was to use an Intel Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) in collaboration with OpenCL. An FPGA was chosen due to its parallel computing 
                                        nature while OpenCL provides a convenient framework to work on FPGAs as well as assisting in optimizing code. By utilizing pipeline parallelism and vectorization techniques we were 
                                        able to achieve a 200% increase in data throughput, improving it to 15-20 GB/s.

                                        For nearly 2 years I worked for Storage Systems Research Center which Is a part of the Jack Baskin School of Engineering 
                                        at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I worked under Distinguished Professor Darrell Long as part of the 
                                        IMSI Catcher Dector team also called "Stingray". On Stingray we worked to detect and geolocate rogue cell phone towers, 
                                        which are cell phone surveillance devices that mimic cell phone towers in order to trick mobile phones into connecting to it. 
                                        This allows the owner of the surveillance device to collect any data that is sent to and from the mobile phone that is connected. 
                                        Our team set out to create an application that would be able to detect and locate one of these devices, as they are often used 
                                        to illegally spy on citizens.

                                        communication with GPS and radio modules. In addition, I assited in devising a communcation protocol 
                                        for sending this data from the Raspberry Pis to our remote server. I also installed real-time operating systems on these clients to
